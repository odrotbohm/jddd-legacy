= jDDD

== Overview

The building blocks of Domain-Driven Design are usually directly or implicitly represented in Java code. The goal of this library is to provide means to more explicitly express those concepts.
The added metadata can then be further inspected to use tools to check rules that apply to the concepts or the interaction of them.

== Modules

- `jddd-core` -- Annotations to demarcate the building blocks of Domain-Driven Design.
- `jddd-jackson` -- A Jackson module to customize the rendering of value objects etc.
